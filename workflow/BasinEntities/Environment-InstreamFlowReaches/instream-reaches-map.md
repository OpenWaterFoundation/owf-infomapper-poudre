# Map: Instream Flow Reaches

## Overview

The ***Instream Flow Reaches*** map shows stream reaches that
are protected by an instream flow water right.
Stream reaches that are recommended for protection are are indicated by the `Status` value.

Instream flow reaches in Colorado are associated with the
[Instream Flow Program of the Colorado Water Conservation Board](https://cwcb.colorado.gov/focus-areas/ecosystem-health/instream-flow-program).
The nonprofit [Colorado Water Trust](https://coloradowatertrust.org/) also works to restore flows on rivers.

Instream flow water rights are generally junior to water rights for agriculture and municipal water supply
and are often appropriated for headwaters in order to protect species in those areas from additional water development.

Instream flow water rights can also be appropriated for "recreational in-channel diversions" such
as the [Poudre River Whitewater Park](https://www.fcgov.com/parks/poudre-river-park).

The Poudre River has long been involved in Colorado Water Law,
including the establishment of [Prior Appropriation Doctrine](https://www.poudreheritage.org/water-war-and-law/).
See the following related to instream flow rights in the Poudre Basin:

The legal framework for augmentation plans is also being used to implement an instream flow right to improve flows in the Poudre:
