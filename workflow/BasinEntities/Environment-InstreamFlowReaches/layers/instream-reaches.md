## Overview

Instream flow reaches in Colorado are associated with the
[Instream Flow Program of the Colorado Water Conservation Board](https://cwcb.colorado.gov/focus-areas/ecosystem-health/instream-flow-program).

Instream flow water rights are generally junior to water rights for agriculture and municipal water supply
and are often appropriated for headwaters in order to protect species in those areas from additional water development.

Instream flow water rights can also be appropriated for "recreational in channel diversions" such
as whitewater parks.

## Map Creation Workflow
