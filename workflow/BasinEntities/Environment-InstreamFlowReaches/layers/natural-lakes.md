The ***Natural Lakes*** layer contains points for natural lakes
that are protected with a lake level water right (similar to instream flow right).

## Overview

Instream flow reaches and lake levels in Colorado are associated with the
[Instream Flow Program of the Colorado Water Conservation Board](https://cwcb.colorado.gov/focus-areas/ecosystem-health/instream-flow-program).

Instream flow and lake level water rights are generally junior to water rights for agriculture and municipal water supply
and are often appropriated for headwaters in order to protect species in those areas from additional water development.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer.
See also the instream flow reach termini layer.

| Instream Flow Reaches layer | [Colorado Instream Flow dataset](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/cwcb/instream-flow/) from the Open Water Foundation created from the [Colorado's Decision Support Systems](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category) Instream Flow dataset. |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to process the data can be found in the
[Poudre Basin Information GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-poudre/tree/master/workflow/BasinEntities/Environment-InstreamFlowReaches).
