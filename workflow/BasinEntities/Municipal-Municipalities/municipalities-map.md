## Background

The Colorado Municipalities map provides information about Colorado municipalities,
focusing on water resources.

### Land Use ###

Land use and water use are related and depend on the characteristics of
a community, including factors such as:

* lot size and landscaping, which impact outdoor water use amount and seasonal variation
* number of residences, multi-family housing, and commercial properties
* whether the community relies on tourism and recreation,
in which case water use is higher due to visitors 

### Municipal Water Providers ###

Municipalities may be served by multiple water providers
(see also the ***Basin Entities / Water Supply - Water Providers*** map),
which are typically utilities and special districts.
Depending on location, municipalities may rely on surface water and groundwater.

### Population ###

Each municipality's planning department (if they have one) typically
estimates historical and forecast population,
in order to make decisions about water resource raw and treated water supplies.
See the ***Basin Entities / Political - Counties*** map for information about
population data.
