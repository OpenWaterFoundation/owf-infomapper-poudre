# Layer: Municipal Water Provider Boundaries

The ***Municipal Water Provider Boundaries*** layer contains boundaries for
municipal water provider service areas, including:

* special districts (water and sanitation districts, metropolitan districts)
* municipal utilities

This layer was created by the Open Water Foundation by merging data from
original sources indicated on the dataset page.

**The layer is incomplete because boundaries for some water providers,
in particular municipal utilities and private companies,
must be acquired individually,
which requires contacting each water provider and arranging for data access.
OWF continues to merge data from multiple sources.**

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Municipal Water Provider Boundaries (Special Districts & Utilities) | [Municipal Water Provider Boundaries dataset](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/owf/municipal-water-provider-boundaries/) from the Open Water Foundation, created from [DOLA GIS data](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/gis.html). |
| Municipal Water Provider Boundaries (only Special Districts) | [Municipal Water Provider Boundaries dataset](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/owf/municipal-water-provider-boundaries/) from the Open Water Foundation, created from [DOLA GIS data](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/gis.html). |
