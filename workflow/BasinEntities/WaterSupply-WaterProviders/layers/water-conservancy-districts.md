## Overview

Major water conservancy and conservation districts typically were formed to fund and manage infrastructure such as reservoirs,
and may have a regional focus covering many issues (river health, policies, etc.).
These districts are in a separate layer because they typically do not provide retail municipal treated water
and the size of the service area would overlap other water districts.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Water Conservancy Districts layer | [Municipal Water Provider Boundaries dataset](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/owf/municipal-water-provider-boundaries/) from the Open Water Foundation, created from the [Special Districts](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/gis.html) layer from the Department of Local Affairs (DOLA). |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to process the data can be found in the
[Poudre Basin Information GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-poudre/tree/master/workflow/BasinEntities/WaterSupply-WaterProviders).
