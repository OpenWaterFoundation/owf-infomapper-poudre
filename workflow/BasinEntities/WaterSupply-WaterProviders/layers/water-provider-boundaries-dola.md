# Layer: Municipal Water Provider Boundaries (only Special Districts)

The ***Municipal Water Provider Boundaries (only Special Districts)*** layer contains boundaries for
municipal water provider service areas for only Special Districts.
The dataset is from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA),
from special districts matching water provide identifiers
(mostly water and sanitation districts and metropolitan districts).

This layer must be merged with other data to provide a complete list of
municipal water providers, which include municipal utilities, private water companies,
and other water providers (in addition to special districts).

This layer is incomplete because it requires obtaining water provider boundaries
from many entities and merging with the special district data from DOLA.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Municipal Water Provider Boundaries (only Special Districts) layer | [Municipal Water Providers Boundaries dataset](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/dola/district-boundaries) from the Open Water Foundation, created from the [Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) Special Districts dataset](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/gis.html). See the OWF dataset for a list of other data that are merged with the special districts dataset to create the final dataset. |

## Workflow
