## Overview

The ***Fire Protection Districts*** layer is shown to indicate which fire protection districts overlap water provider areas.
Fire protection districts often have requirements for water availability, such as water pressure,
that must be met when requesting a new water service line.
In some cases, such as for commercial buildings, water must be available for sprinkler systems.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Fire Protection Districts layer | [Colorado DOLA Districts dataset](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/dola/district-boundaries/) from the Open Water Foundation, created from the [Fire Protection Districts](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/assets/html/gis.html) layer from the Department of Local Affairs (DOLA). |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to process the data can be found in the
[Poudre Basin Information GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-poudre/tree/master/workflow/BasinEntities/WaterSupply-WaterProviders).
