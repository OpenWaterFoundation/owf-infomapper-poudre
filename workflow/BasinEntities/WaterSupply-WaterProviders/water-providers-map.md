## Background

The Colorado Water Providers map provides information about municipal water providers.
Water providers include municipal utilities, [special districts](https://www.sdaco.org/),
and other organizations.  See also the ***Basin Entities / Municipal - Municipalities*** map.
Multiple water providers may serve a single municipality.
Unincorporated areas in a county may also be served by a water provider.
Each utility typically operates as an "enterprise fund",
which means that its revenue is from rate payers and is separate from general fund revenue.
Whereas a city utility may be aligned with city planning across departments,
special districts focus on the purpose(s) for which they were created,
such as water supply and wastewater.

Water providers maintain a portfolio of water rights, water supplies, and infrastructure necessary
to serve their customers through a range of climatic and hydrologic conditions,
including droughts and natural disasters.
In the Poudre Basin, municipal water providers may own shares in ditch companies and
transfer water from agricultural to municipal uses.
Land developers must typically provide water to cities and do so either by providing water rights
(often from agricultural transfers) or "cash in lieu of water rights".
Cities with sufficient/senior water rights portfolios may prefer cash in order to invest in
infrastructure, such as
[Fort Collins' Halligan Reservoir Expansion](https://www.fcgov.com/halligan/).
Large reservoir projects are subject to lengthy permitting processes and extensive mitigation of impacts,
which increases their cost.
Cities with insufficient/junior water rights portfolios may prefer that
developers provide water rights to expand their portfolio.
However, reallocating agricultural water rights to municipal use may result in
development of agricultural lands that have high agricultural value and are some distance
away from cities, resulting in increased transportation and other issues.

[Northern Water](https://www.northernwater.org/) is a major raw water provider in the Poudre Basin
and provides "supplemental supply" to its customers, meaning that the supplies are in addition
to each entity's base supplies.
Northern water raw water supply includes water from the Colorado Basin via transbasin diversion
as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson (CBT) project.
Although Colorado water law allows transbasin water to be fully consumed (reused to extinction),
CBT water can only be used once because the Northern Water service area extends to the
state line and downstream users are entitled to return flows because they pay a fee for CBT water.
