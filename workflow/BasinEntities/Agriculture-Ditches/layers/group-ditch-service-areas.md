# Layer Group: District 3 Ditch Service Areas

The District 3 Ditch Service Areas layer group contains layers
for ditch service areas for historical years.
The service areas were digitized as part of
Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

Note the following:

* Ditch service areas change over time, due to irrigating more or less lands.
* Ditches that have a diversion point in the Poudre Basin (Water District 3) may irrigate lands outside
  of the Poudre Basin.
* Ditch service areas overlap urban areas - see the ***Historical Data / Agriculture - Irrigated Lands***
  menu for detailed data for irrigated parcels.
  When urban areas grow onto irrigated lands, the water right ownership is typically transferred to those
  urban entities, although water rental programs may continue to provide water to agriculture in many years.
