## Overview

The ***Canals*** layer has been created for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)
to identify ditch infrastructure.
See also the ***Historical Data / Agriculture - Irrigated Lands*** map for detailed crop data.

Canals are typically located on the upstream side of ditch service areas in order
to use gravity to irrigate lands in the ditch service area.
Laterals may have the same name as the main ditch, or may have a different name.

## Data Sources

The following are data sources for this layer:

| **Resource** | **Source** |
| -- | -- |
| Canal layer | [Colorado Canals layer](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/dwr/irrigated-lands/) from the Open Water Foundation datasets, created from [Colorado's Decision Support Systems GIS Data by Category - Irrigation Ditches](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category). |

## Map Creation Workflow

The workflow to process the data can be found in the
[Poudre Basin Information GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-poudre/tree/master/workflow/BasinEntities/Agriculture-Ditches).
