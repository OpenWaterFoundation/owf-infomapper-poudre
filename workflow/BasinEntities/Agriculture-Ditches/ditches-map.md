# Map: Poudre Ditch Service Areas

* Overview

## Overview

The Poudre Ditch Service Areas map shows the areal extent of water deliveries for ditches.
See also the [***Historical Data / Agriculture - Irrigated Lands***](#map/hist-ag-irrigated)
map for detailed information about irrigated parcels.
Although the overall service area may not have changed much over time,
the area being irrigated for agriculture has decreased as agricultural land has been converted
to other uses, such as urban areas.

Irrigation in the Poudre Basin benefits from elevation change and gravity-driven water deliveries.
Many ditches divert from the Poudre River higher in the basin
and use ditches (canals) that stretch for miles before delivering water to agricultural lands
and irrigation reservoirs, sometimes on lands outside of the Poudre Basin.
Seepage losses from ditches and agriculture recharge groundwater and sustain wetlands
that provide habitat to wildlife.
Colorado laws allow ditches to cross lands owned by other entities,
often using easements to grant access to the ditch.
This can lead to issues, such as in cases where large trees have grown on the easement
(is tree maintenance the responsibility of the property owner, the ditch company, or local government?).

In addition to ditches, many irrigation companies also own storage reservoirs,
which typically fill in the fall and winter and are lowered in the summer to provide Irrigation water.
The flows released from higher-elevation reservoirs to the Poudre River increase streamflow
before being diverted at the ditch diversion structure.
Such release deliveries are scheduled by ditch companies to coincide with the schedules of
ditch company staff and farmers; consequently,
water that is delivered via the river may not occur at times that are desired by recreators.

As agricultural lands are converted to other uses, it is increasingly important to
plan for multiple uses of the ditches, such as for trails,
stormwater drainage, and open space.
Municipalities (including utilities and water districts) often buy shares in ditch
companies in order to increase water supply for growing cities.
These supplies may not be needed in many years and can be rented back to farmers.

The four largest ditches in the basin are listed below:

* [North Poudre Irrigation Company](https://npicwater.com/)
* The Water Supply and Storage Company
