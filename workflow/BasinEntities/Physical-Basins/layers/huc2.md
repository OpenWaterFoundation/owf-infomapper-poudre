# Layer:  HUC2 Basins

The ***HUC2 Basins*** layer contains data for Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basins
from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
HUC basins are often used when working with hydrologic and environmental data.
This 2-digit HUC basin (Missouri Region) contains the 8-digit HUC Cache la Poudre Basin.
