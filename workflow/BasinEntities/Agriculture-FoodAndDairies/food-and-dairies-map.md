## Overview

The Food and Dairies map shows the location of local food sources and dairies,
in order to illustrate the relationship between water and local food production.
Large-scale farms are not included on the map but are also important for local food production.

Visit organization websites to determine ways to purchase local food products.

## Local Food ###

Local food sources include local farms, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), food banks, and other organizations.

CSAs rely on community members to buy shares of a farm's output,
and in return provides locally grown farm products on a schedule,
with deliveries and/or pickups from the farm and other locations.
See the following resources and the entity's websites for details:

## Dairies ###

Dairies provide milk and other products locally and for national organizations.
Dairies are major consumers of feed for cattle and consequently have a large water footprint.
