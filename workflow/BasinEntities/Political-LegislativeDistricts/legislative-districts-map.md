# Map: Colorado Legislative Districts

* Overview

## Overview

The Colorado Legislative Districts map provides information about Colorado legislative districts,
for County, State, and Federal representatives.

The map is configured to display either the House or Senate layer
because they use the same colors for symbols and are transparent,
and displaying on top of each other is confusing.

## Layer Groups

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| County Legislative Districts | Colorado county legislative districts. **Need to add.**|
