# Map: Colorado Legislative Districts

* Overview
* Layer Groups

---------------

## Overview

The Colorado Legislative Districts map provides information about Colorado legislative districts,
for County, State, and Federal representatives.

The map is configured to display either the House or Senate layer, but not both at the same time,
because they use the same colors for polygon fill,
and displaying on top of each other is confusing.

The maps use the final 2021 districts based on 2020 census,
from the [Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions](https://redistricting.colorado.gov/).
Use the following to access previous districts:

* [data.openwaterfoundation.org](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/circ/legislative-districts/) - dataset page
* [Colorado Legislative Districts (2011)](https://poudre.openwaterfoundation.org/2.3.0/#/map/entities-legislative) - older Poudre Basin Information version (may be disabled in the future)
