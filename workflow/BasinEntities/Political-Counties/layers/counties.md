| Dark green | Counties that physically intersect the Poudre Basin:  Larimer and Weld counties. |
| Light green | Counties that are within the South Platte basin and benefit from the Poudre directly or indirectly (**more detail will be added in the future**). |
| Yellow | Counties that currently or in the future will benefit from transbasin diversions out of the Poudre Basin (**more detail will be added in the future**). |
