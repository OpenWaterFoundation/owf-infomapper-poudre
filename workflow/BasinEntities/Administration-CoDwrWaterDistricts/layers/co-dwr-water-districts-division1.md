# Layer: Colorado DWR Division 1 Water Districts

The Colorado DWR Division 1 Water Districts layer contains water districts
in the South Platte Basin and illustrates the basins for water administration.

The Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)
delineates Colorado's river basins into
Water Divisions and Water Districts, each of which have a number and a name.
Water Districts correspond to smaller basins, such as the Poudre River Basin (Water District 3).

Water Divisions and Districts are administered by DWR staff according
to Colorado's Prior Appropriation water rights doctrine,
in order to ensure compliance with water laws.
