# Layer: CO DWR Division  1

The Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)
delineates Colorado's river basins into
Water Divisions and Water Districts, each of which have a number and a name.
Water Divisions correspond to large river basins such as the South Platte (Water Division 1).
Water Districts correspond to smaller basins, such as the Poudre River Basin (Water District 3).
Water Divisions and Districts are administered by DWR staff according
to Colorado's Prior Appropriation water rights doctrine,
in order to ensure compliance with water laws.
