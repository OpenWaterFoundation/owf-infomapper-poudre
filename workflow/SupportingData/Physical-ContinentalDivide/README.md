# Physical-ContinentalDivide #

This folder contains workflow files to create the continental divide supporting layer.
This layer is used as a background layer for multiple maps.
The `03-create-continental-divide-map.gp` file can be run in the GeoProcessor to view the map locally.
However, the map is not added to the InfoMapper configuration.

Refer to the layer's dataset page on the OWF website for information about the dataset.
