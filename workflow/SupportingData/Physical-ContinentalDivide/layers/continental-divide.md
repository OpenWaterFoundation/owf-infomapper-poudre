# Layer: Continental Divide

The Continental Divide layer contains linework for the continental divide.
The layer is useful to illustrate a physical boundary between Colorado's
east (eastern) and west (western) slopes, with streams generally flowing
to the east or west depending on whether the stream is on the east or west
side of the continental divide.

The Continental Divide and other physical boundaries also provide a physical barrier
for wildfires, weather, and other phenomena.
Wildfires do jump the divide, especially during high wind conditions.

It is often stated that roughly 80% of Colorado's population is on the east side of the continental divide
and roughly 80% of the water supply is on the west side of the continental divide.
Much of the high value agriculture is also on the east side, such as in the South Platte and Arkansas basins.
Consequently, transbasin diversions from west to east side are used to ensure that
sufficient water supply is available for human activities in highly populated basins.
