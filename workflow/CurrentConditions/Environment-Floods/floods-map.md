## Overview

**This map is under development.**

The Flood Warning map provides information about flood monitoring in the Poudre Basin.
Flooding can occur for various reasons including rain events, rapid snowmelt events,
rain on snow events,
infrastructure failure, or a combination of causes.
The magnitude of a flood can also vary from neighborhood to region,
depending on the amount of water, and local physical conditions.

Flooding impacts may be made worse by additional hazards,
such as debris carried in the water, which can cause damming behind bridges, culverts, and other structures.
Flood water may also carry contaminants such as petroleum products, septic system and sewer waste,
and chemicals.

Although there may be opportunities to capture flood water and use for water supply,
such as agricultural irrigation and municipal raw water supply, the high flows, debris,
and contaminants experienced during flooding events can pose challenges to using flood water for water supply.

High flows can benefit the environment by removing sediment via flushing flows,
distribute water to riverine ecosystems, and perform processes that are beneficial to the river.
However, sediment that is removed from one area may be deposited in other areas and
river channel may be reconfigured, which has impacts.

Flood control detention ponds, reservoirs, and other storage do provide an opportunity to capture flood water
so that it can be managed over time.
However, water rights laws control the amount of time that flood water can be retained and how the water can be used.
This is because flood water is part of a shared system and the right to use the water is controlled by water law.

This map focuses on providing access to real-time flood warning information.
**Flood warning systems provide more detailed information about current and historical flood conditions
and should be consulted to understand current flooding conditions.**

### Flood Warning Systems

The following table provides links to publicly-accessible flood warning systems that provide data for the Poudre Basin.
Stations typically collect precipitation data and may also collect other data types such as weather data,
water level, discharge, and water quality.
Implementing stations that measure water level and discharge requires additional effort and cost.
Flood warning stations typically report data on a regular interval (e.g., once an hour) and
transmit values when a rain event occurs;
however, these stations typically do not report "continuous" data (e.g., 5 minute) due to cost of communications and
because conditions such as precipitation often do not change.

| **Flood Warning System** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| [Larimer County Flood Warning System](https://larimerco-ns5.trilynx-novastar.systems/novastar/operator/) | Regional flood warning system including Larimer and Weld counties. The website uses NovaStar software is supported by [TriLynx Systems](https://trilynx.systems/) and [Water and Earth Technologies](https://www.wetec.us/), and collaboration with the [Open Water Foundation](https://openwatefoundation.org) on the Poudre Basin Information Website. All of these organizations are located in Fort Collins. |
| [Fort Collins Flood Warning System](https://gisweb.fcgov.com/HTML5Viewer/Index.html?viewer=Flood%20Warning) | Flood warning system maintained by For Collins.  See also the main [Flood Warning System](https://www.fcgov.com/utilities/what-we-do/stormwater/flooding/warning-system) web page.

## Layer Groups

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| Flood Warning | Flood warning system monitoring stations. |
| Floodplain Regulation | Floodplain regulation organizations, often associated with stormwater utilities. |
| Poudre Stream Reaches | Stream lines for named streams and rivers. |
| Wildfires | **Evaluating** Colorado wildfire burn areas. |
| Soil Burn Severity | **Evaluating** Burn severity assessment from Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER). |
| National Parks | **Evaluating** National parks impacted by wildfires. |
| CO DWR Water Districts | Division of Water Resources water districts, to highlight the Poudre Basin (Water District 3).  See the [***Basin Entities / Administration - CO DWR Water Districts***](#map/entities-codwr-waterdistricts) map for more information. |
| Background Layers | Background layers that provide a frame of reference. |
| Continental Divide | Continental divide, illustrating a geological boundary between basins. |
