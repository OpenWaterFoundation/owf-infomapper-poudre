# Layer: Flood Organizations

The Flood Organizations layer shows the locations of organizations
that provide programs related to floodplain regulation and flood warning,
including county and municipal government.

Organizations that have offices outside of the basin have been assigned a location
at the lower end of the basin in order to be visible on the map.
