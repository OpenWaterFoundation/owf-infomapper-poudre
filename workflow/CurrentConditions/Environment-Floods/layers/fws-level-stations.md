# Layer: Flood Warning Water Level Stations

The Flood Warning System (FWS) water level stations layer contains flood warning water level (stage) stations for the Poudre Basin
and Northern Colorado region,
used to display basic current conditions information and provide links to the FWS station dashboards.

Characteristics of water level stations are as follows:

* return water level data types
* are located near a stream or other water body
* may also collect other data types such as precipitation
  (Fort Collins flood warning system stations typically collect precipitation but not water level)
* typically use a pressure transducer or radar below bridges
* may be taken out of service in cold weather to protect the sensors from freezing

The map marker is currently not color-coded.
The [Larimer County Flood Warning System](https://larimerco-ns5.trilynx-novastar.systems/novastar/operator/)
provides features to view data and alarm conditions,
including precipitation alarms based on precipitation duration frequency levels (i.e., 10-year storm).
