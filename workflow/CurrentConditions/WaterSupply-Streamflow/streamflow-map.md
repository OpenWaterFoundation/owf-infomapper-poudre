# Map: Poudre Streamflow

* Overview
* Layer Groups

-------------

## Overview

The Poudre Streamflow map shows locations that provide real-time flow data,
including diversions and stream gages.
The State of Colorado and other entities maintain a network of stations to monitor
streamflow, diversions, reservoir releases, and other data.
The data from these telemetry stations can be used to understand river conditions
in order to make administrative and operations decisions.

## Layer Groups

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
