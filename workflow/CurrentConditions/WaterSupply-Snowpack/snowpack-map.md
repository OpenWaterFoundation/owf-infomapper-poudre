## Overview

The Current Snowpack map provides information about current snowpack conditions in the Poudre Basin,
focusing on water supply.

## Introduction ##

Water supply from snow melt is the primary source of surface water in Colorado.
The snowpack is the accumulation of snow from multiple snow events that occur during cold months
and serves as a natural water supply reservoir.
The snowpack melts in the spring and summer, with rapid melt typically occurring over 2-3 weeks in early to mid-summer.
Some snowpack melt water flows into streams, which results in a rapid increase of water supply and may at times cause flooding,
especially if rain storms occur at the same time, typically adding to flows at lower elevations.
Other melt water seeps through the ground and provides year-long base flows in streams.

## Documentation Resources ##

The following are useful documentation resources:

* [CWCB Water Availability and Flood Task Forces](https://cwcb.colorado.gov/water-availability-flood-task-forces) - includes snowpack and other information
* [Western Water Assessment: Snowpack Monitoring in the Rocky Mountain West (PDF)](https://wwa.colorado.edu/publications/reports/Snowpack_User_Guide_February_2021.pdf)

## Avalanches ##

Avalanches can pose a severe safety hazard and impact roadways.  See the following resources.

* [Colorado Avalanche Information Center](https://www.avalanche.state.co.us/)

## Climate Change ##

Climate change impacts, including changing the location, amount, and timing of snowpack accumulation and melt.
See the following resources for climate and snow:

* [Intermountain West Climate Dashboard from Western Water Assessment](https://wwa.colorado.edu/climate/dashboard.html)

## Dust on Snow ##

Dust on snow can have a significant impact on the rate of snow melt.
See the following resources:

* [Colorado Dust-on-snow Program](http://www.codos.org/)
* ["Dust on Snow Controls Springtime River Rise in West"](https://www.weathernationtv.com/news/dust-snow-controls-springtime-river-rise-west/#.WnDKkmHsc6I.twitter)

## Wildfires ##

Wildfires impact snowpack accumulation and melt.  For example, less forest canopy allows sunlight to more directly shine on snowpack.
More information will be added here in the future.  See the following resources:

* ***Current Conditions / Environment - Wildfires***
