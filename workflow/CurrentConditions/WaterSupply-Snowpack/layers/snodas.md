# Layer: Snowpack (SNODAS)

The ***Snowpack (SNODAS)*** layer contains daily snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) estimate
for water supply basins, using data from the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS).
Mean SWE estimates for water supply basins are useful to understand general snowpack conditions.
SNODAS is useful because it provides data in locations without SNOTEL.
Use the [State of Colorado's CDSS SNODAS Tools website](https://snodas.cdss.state.co.us/app/) for more information,
including graphs of snow conditions over time and estimates of snow coverage.

The [latest version of SNODAS Tools](https://snodas.openwaterfoundation.org/)
is available on the Open Water Foundation website and may include
improvements that are not available on the State's website.
This version uses the data from the State's website.
This version is periodically updated to the State's website during maintenance.
