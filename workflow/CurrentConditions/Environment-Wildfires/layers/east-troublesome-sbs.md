# Layer: East Troublesome Fire Soil Burn Severity 

The East Troublesome Fire Soil Burn Severity layer contains results of the
Soil Burn Severity (SBS) assessment from the
[Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) evaluation](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/photos/COARF/2020-11-12-1436-East-Troublesome-PostFire-BAER/related_files/pict20201117-154930-0.pdf).
This information is used to evaluate recovery actions such as treatments to prevent erosion.
Burn area severity categories are as follows (for more information, see the [Field Guide for Mapping Post-fire Soil Burn Severity](http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr243.pdf)):

| **Severity** | **Code** | **Description** |
| -- | -- | -- |
| <span style="color:#ff0000">High</span> | 4 | **High**: All or nearly all of the pre-fire ground cover and surface organic matter (litter, duff, and fine roots) is generally consumed, and charring may be visible on larger roots. Soil is often gray, orange, or reddish at the ground surface where large fuels were concentrated and consumed. |
| <span style="color:#ffff00">Moderate</span> | 3 | **Moderate**: Up to 80 percent of the pre-fire ground cover (litter and ground fuels) may be consumed but generally not all of it. There may be potential for recruitment of effective ground cover from scorched needles or leaves remaining in the canopy that will soon fall to the ground. Soil structure is generally unchanged. |
| <span style="color:#00ffaa">Low</span> | 2 | **Low**: The ground surface, including any exposed mineral soil, may appear (lightly charred), and the canopy and understory vegetation willlikely appear “green.” |
| <span style="color:#006600">Unburned / Very Low</span> | 1 | **Unburned / Very Low**: Little to no burn expected within these areas. Canopy and ground litter completely intact. Little to no vegetative mortality expected. |
