## Overview

The National Parks layer group provides information about national parks.
The National Parks program was established to conserve natural resources.
See:

* [History of the National Park Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Park_Service)

National parks and other natural areas provide water supply from snowpack,
surface water runoff, and groundwater.
These water supplies are generally very high quality but can be degraded by
active wildfires (ash, etc.), runoff from wildfire burn areas (sediment, minerals, solids),
and other pollutants (transported by air, spills, human and animal impacts, etc.).  See:

National parks are also intimately related to climate change as they can serve as
a carbon sink, carbon source (wildfires), and are greatly impacted by changes due to climate change
(snowpack, glaciers, landscape and species changes, etc.).  See:
