## Overview

The ***Irrigated Lands*** map shows irrigated lands for multiple historical years.
The amount of irrigated acreage in recent years has decreased as urban areas have grown onto agricultural lands.
Agriculture uses over 80% of water supplies.
This water is viewed as a supply for growing municipalities but there is also strong
interest in retaining irrigated agriculture and the benefits that it brings.
In the South Platte Basin, the return flows from irrigation recharge groundwater,
contribute to wetlands, and are a water supply for downstream water users.

See also the [***Basin Entities / Agriculture - Ditches***](#map/entities-ditches) map for information
about ditch service areas.
