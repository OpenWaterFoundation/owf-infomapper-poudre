# Layer: District 3 Irrigated Lands

The District 3 Irrigated Lands layers include irrigated lands data for historical years.
The parcels, crop type, irrigation method, and water source were digitized as part of
Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

Note the following:

* The majority of acreage is corn and forage crops for livestock.
* Irrigated lands have been displaced by urban areas over time.
When urban areas grow onto irrigated lands, the water right ownership is typically transferred to those
urban entities, although water rental programs may continue to provide water to agriculture in many years.
