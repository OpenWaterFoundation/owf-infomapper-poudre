# dashboards

This folder contains dashboard configurations for the website.

Unlike the `../workflows/`, which copy files into the `web/` folder,
dashboard files currently exist in this folder.
Dynamic content including `downloads` and `results` is ignored from the repository with the main `.gitignore` file.
In the future the dashboards may be renamed to match the specific words in the application menus.
The following is a list of the dashboards:

| **Dashboard Folder** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| `main` | The main dashboard, which lists many indicators. |
| `test` | An initial test - may be deleted in the future. |
| `water-affordability` | ***Water Affordability Dashboard*** dashboard, preliminary work. |
| `water-supply-basin` | ***Water Supply (for Basin) Dashboard*** , with basin-wide indicators. |
| `water-supply-suppliers` | ***Water Supply (for Suppliers) Dashboard*** , indicators specific to suppliers - planned but not yet implemented. |
