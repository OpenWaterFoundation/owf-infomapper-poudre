## Introduction

The information products under ***Future Planning*** are related to planning for
a longer time horizon such as decades into the future.

Planning for the future typically involves organizations that have funded programs
to plan and carry out projects.
Organizations and plans have a geographic footprint.
Organizations may perform comprehensive planning
or may be limited to focused mission and goals.

For example, organizations that provide treated water to municipalities,
such as water districts,
plan for growth and perform activities necessary to meet the water demands of their customers,
including acquiring more raw water supplies, increasing water use efficiency,
and enhancing infrastructure.
Environmental organizations plan for land use and water supply impacts
and seek to protect and enhance the environment,
such as ensuring streamflow for aquatic species,
wildfire recovery, and overall watershed health.
