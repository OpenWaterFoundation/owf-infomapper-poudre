## Introduction ##

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this website.
The [Poudre Runs Through It Study/Work Group (PRTI)](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/prti/) is an initial collaborator
and seeks to "make the Poudre River the world's best example of a healthy, working river".
It is envisioned that the website will be used for education,
operational support for water entities, and public access.

The Open Water Foundation is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.

This website and content published on the website use the following open source software:

* [InfoMapper](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-user) - OWF open source map-based information tool
* [GeoProcessor](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/) - OWF open source spatial data processing tool built on QGIS
* [TSTool](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/tstool/) - OpenCDSS software to process time series into useful products

This website is under development.  OWF uses its own resources for research and development and is
seeking additional funding to develop open source software tools and open datasets that
can be applied to the Poudre and other river basins.

## Map Contents ##

Maps on this website focus on topical themes at various spatial and temporal scales.
This design allows specific topics to be presented in more detail than simply showing the layer on a map.
Links to other maps and websites are provided to allow a deeper dive on a topic.

Some maps provide statewide data, whereas other maps are limited to smaller area.
This approach is taken because loading large map layers slows the web browser, 
because creating and reviewing larger datasets requires more funding and time,
and because such data vary between basins and require different explanation.
Other basin websites can be implemented to focus on the issues for those basins.
